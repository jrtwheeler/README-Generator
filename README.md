  ## Description
   The README generator is a javascript program that produces a high quality, formatted README file upon demand. The README file lets visitors to a GitHub repo know the details of the product, including a project description, usage requirements, opportunities to contribute, the license, questions, and installation directions. Yet a lot of coders overlook it and fail to include it at all. This automation saves the time needed to assemble the README and automates its production.
